## Background

I am currently the Forestry and Natural Resources Agent in Baker County for Oregon State University Extension Service. My educational background includes Forest Biometrics, Forest Modelling, Data Analysis, Silviculture, and Forest Management. I earned an M.S. in Forest Biometrics in 2019 and a B.S. in Forest Management in 2016, both from Oregon State University. My current research includes modelling growth responses to operational nitrogen fertilization of Douglas-fir plantations in western Oregon and examing the effects of dwarf mistletoe on thinned, even-aged ponderosa pine stands.
