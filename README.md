## Background

I am currently an Assistant Professor (Practice) and Extension Forester for Baker and Grant Counties with Oregon State University Extension Service. My educational background includes Forest Biometrics, Forest Modelling, Data Analysis, Silviculture, and Forest Management. I earned an M.S. in Forest Biometrics in 2019 and a B.S. in Forest Management in 2016, both from Oregon State University. My current research includes modelling growth responses to operational nitrogen fertilization of Douglas-fir plantations in western Oregon and examing the effects of western dwarf mistletoe on thinned, even-aged ponderosa pine stands across eastern Oregon and Washington.
